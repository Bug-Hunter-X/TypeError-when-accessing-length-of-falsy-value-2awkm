# JavaScript Falsy Value Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error that occurs when trying to access the `length` property of a variable that might not be an object. The initial code does not handle unexpected falsy inputs which may result in a `TypeError`.

The solution provides a more robust way to handle these edge cases, improving code reliability.
